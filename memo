installation:
- manual vs ansible installation
- using pyenv or virtualenv or pip or pipfile

usage:
- "The user will defines their"
- leaves the user wanting to know more


at the high level:
- what are the inputs?
- what are the outputs?
- what is this even doing?
- here is the type of input, and how it is transformed, and the output
    - config files --> input files
    - param files --> workflow params

at the command level:
- taco [verb] [flag]

- talk about verbs (table?)
    - what workflow do you want to run
    - workflows? what are those?
    - rules?

- talk about flags (table?)
    - what flags set the config and param files
    - other flags?

- rules?
- workflows?
- pipelines?
- how to provide input files?

----

running:

- inputs
    - config (input files)
    - params
    - defaults
        - precedence order
        - user specified > defaults in workflow > defaults from user
    - other flags
    - will discuss particulars of workflows below
    - if flags are not recognized, try to pass them on to snakemake
        (snakemake cli-to-api parser?)

- workflows
    - pages for various workflows
    - for each workflow page:
        - options.
        - details.
        - uniform setup, for each page.
        - ansible-like
        - table for options and descriptions

- outputs
    - how to configure where output goes
    - where's my stuff???
