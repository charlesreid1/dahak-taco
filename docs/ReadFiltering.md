# Workflow: `read_filtering`

The `read_filtering` workflow uses 
`fastq` and `trimmomatic` to assess
the quality of sequencer reads and 
filter out low-quality reads.

The user has control over the names 
and URLs of sequence data that is 
downloaded, as well as parameters like
the quality threshold.
