# Snakemake Rules

A brief summary of how Snakemake rules are implemented and organized.

We follow the conventions set in the [snakemake-rules](https://github.com/percyfal/snakemake-rules)
repository, and groups all rules into `.rule` files and all parameters into
`.settings` files.

**Rules:** `rules/dahak/*.rules`

**Parameters:** `rules/dahak/*.settings`
