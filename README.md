# dahak-taco

taco is an experimental command line interface for dahak workflows. 

## Installing 

See [INSTALLING](/INSTALLING.md) for installation instructions.

## Using

See the [dahak-taco documentation](https://dahak-metagenomics.github.io/dahak-taco/).

## Notes

* using subworkflows is an excellent idea in theory, a terrible idea in practice
* snakemake cannot handle subworkflows properly
* none of the rules in the subworkflows actually work
* list rules `snakemake -l` shows nothing
* target files or target rules both fail
