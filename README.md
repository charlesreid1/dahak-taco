# dahak-taco

taco is an experimental command line interface for dahak workflows. 

when it is no longer experimental, we will `s/taco/dahak/`.

## Conceptualizing the Interface

See the [Interface.md](/Interface.md) document for 
detailed examples of how a desirable interface might behave.

## How It Works

Under the hood, dahak-taco uses argparser, a Python library
for parsing command line arguments.

See [HowItWorks.md](/HowItWorks.md) for more info.
