# How It Works

The general idea is to design a program that can handle
complex logic, workflows, user settings, software, etc.

To do this, the interface is designed around help functionality.
(Fortunately, this is a core idea in argparser.)
If you don't run with the correct arguments, or with
any arguments, the program will help guide you through
what to do.

## Argparse

We use argparse to parse comamnd line arguments from the user.
