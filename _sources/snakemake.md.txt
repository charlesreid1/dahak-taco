# Snakemake Rules

This section covers how the Snakemake
rules are implemented and organized.

First, we follow the conventions 
set in the [snakemake-rules](https://github.com/percyfal/snakemake-rules)
repository, and groups all rules into
`.rule` files and all parameters into
`.settings` files.

The rules are contained in the 
`rules/dahak/` directory.

The Snakefile in the main repository
directory includes each rule file, 
and each rule file includes the necessary
settings files.



## List of Rules

Use Snakemake to list all of the 
available rules:



or, use taco (not implemented):

```
taco ls
```

(which just wraps the Snakemake
command to list all available rules.)
